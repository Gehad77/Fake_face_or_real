# Fake Image Detection: Training, Evaluation, and Web Deployment

- Introduction:
In this project, we developed a fake image detection system that predicts the authenticity of images. By training a model on a large dataset of 100,000 images and evaluating its performance using separate test and validation sets of 20,000 images each, we achieved an accuracy rate of 82%. Moreover, we deployed the trained model on the web using Flask, providing users with a user-friendly interface to assess image authenticity in real-time.

- Dataset Preparation and Training:
We carefully curated a dataset of 100,000 images, comprising both authentic and manipulated samples. The dataset covers various genres and content types, ensuring the model's exposure to a diverse range of manipulation techniques. We trained our model for 75 epochs using this dataset, utilizing transfer learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn distinctive features that differentiate between real and fake images.

- Evaluation and Accuracy:
To assess the model's performance, we partitioned our dataset into a test set and a validation set, each containing 20,000 images. After training, we evaluated the model's predictions on these sets, achieving an accuracy rate of 82%. This indicates that our model successfully learned to identify fake images and perform at a commendable level of accuracy.

- Web Deployment with Flask:
To make our fake image detection system accessible to users, we integrated the trained model into a web application using Flask, a Python web framework. Flask provides a straightforward way to create web applications, allowing us to connect our model to a user interface. Through the Flask application, users can upload images and obtain instant predictions regarding their authenticity.

- User Interaction and Real-Time Predictions:
The Flask application offers a user-friendly interface, enabling users to interact with the system seamlessly. Upon accessing the web application, users can upload an image of their choice, which is then processed by the integrated model. The model analyzes the image and provides an immediate prediction regarding its authenticity. Users can receive real-time feedback and make informed assessments of the uploaded images.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, our project encompasses the development, evaluation, and deployment of a fake image detection system. By training a model on a large dataset of 100,000 images and evaluating its performance with separate test and validation sets, we achieved an accuracy rate of 82%. Furthermore, we deployed the model on the web using Flask, offering users a user-friendly interface to assess image authenticity in real-time. This project contributes to combating visual misinformation, promoting trust, and ensuring the integrity of images in various domains, including journalism, content moderation, and social media platforms.
